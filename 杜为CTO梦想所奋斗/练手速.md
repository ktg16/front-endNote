light'em up light'em up
Tell me Where you are tell me where you  are 
The summer nights the bright  lights
And the shooting starts they brealk my heart
I'm calling you now but you're not picking up 

your shadows so close if you are still in love

The light a match light a match 
Baby in the dark show me where you are
Where you are

Oh love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh love 
Tell me there's a river I can swim 
That will bring you back to me 
Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh love
God I miss you every single day
And now you're so far away
So far away
It's breaking me I'm losing you 
We were far from prefect but we were worth it

Too many fights and we cried 

But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me 
You're calling mew now but I can't pick  

You shadow's too close and I'm still in love

The summer's over now  but somehow 

It still breaks my heart

We could have the starts oh

Oh love 

How I miss you every single day

When I see you on those  streets

Oh love 

Tell me there's a river

I can swim that will bring you back to me 

Cause I don't know how to love someone  else

Idon't konw how to forget your face 
Ohlove
God I miss you every single day

And now you're so far away 

so far away 

so fay away

Oh so far away

so fay away

oh love

How I miss you every single day

When I see you on those  streets

Oh love 

Tell me there's a river

I can swim that will bring you back to me 

Cause I don't know how to love someone  else

Idon't konw how to forget your face 
Ohlove
God I miss you every single day

When you're so far away
